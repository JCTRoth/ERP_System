== Overview

The ERP system uses a microservices architecture with services written in .NET 8 and Java Spring Boot 3.2. All services expose GraphQL APIs and participate in Apollo Federation.

== .NET Services

=== Common Patterns

All .NET services follow these patterns:

* **GraphQL**: HotChocolate 14.0.0 with Apollo Federation
* **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core 8.0.2
* **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens
* **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns

==== Database Schema

[source,text]
----
Templates
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── company_id
├── key (unique per company)
├── name
├── content (AsciiDoc)
├── language
├── document_type
├── assigned_state
├── is_active
├── created_at
└── updated_at
----

== GraphQL Federation

All services participate in Apollo Federation:

[source,yaml]
----
# supergraph-config.yaml
subgraphs:
  users:
    routing_url: http://user-service:5000/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://user-service:5000/graphql
  shops:
    routing_url: http://shop-service:5003/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://shop-service:5003/graphql
----

=== Federation Entities

Services can extend entities from other services:

[source,graphql]
----
# UserService
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
}

# ShopService (extending User)
extend type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  orders: [Order!]!
}
----

== Database Setup

Each service has its own PostgreSQL database:

[cols="30,30,40"]
|===
| Service | Database | Port

| UserService | userdb | 5432
| ShopService | shopdb | 5436
| AccountingService | accountingdb | 5437
| MasterdataService | masterdatadb | 5438
| CompanyService | companydb | 5433
| NotificationService | notificationdb | 5434
| TranslationService | translationdb | 5435
|===

== Authentication Flow

1. User sends credentials to UserService
2. UserService validates and issues JWT tokens
3. Client includes access token in Authorization header
4. Gateway passes token to all subgraph requests
5. Each service validates the token

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  login(email: "user@example.com", password: "password") {
    accessToken
    refreshToken
    user { id email }
  }
}
----

== Error Handling

Standardized error responses:

[source,json]
----
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "serviceName": "UserService"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

== Health Checks

All services expose health endpoints:

* **.NET**: `/health` (ASP.NET Health Checks)
* **Java**: `/actuator/health` (Spring Actuator)

== Metrics

Prometheus metrics available at:

* **.NET**: `/metrics`
* **Java**: `/actuator/prometheus`
